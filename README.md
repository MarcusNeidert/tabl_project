# tabl by Marcus Neidert & Karl Lundqvist

Tabl is a food challenge generator in which the user (chef) presets intolerances, available cookware and preferred style of cooking. 
These presets are later on used as guidelines for what kind of food challenges the chef is able to retrieve.
The program is by no means perfect, but it is a start that hopefully can be expanded, refined and further developed.

About us:
Me and Karl are currently rounding up our last year of a bachelor in industrial design, this project was part of a course in Object-Oriented Programming (Python) and
building a food-related application resonated well with us. My personal hope (Marcus) is that we continue developing the site further to make it ready for publishing, 
where it is planned to be a free-service for anyone to use. Inspiration for the application comes from https://vadfanskajaglagatillmiddag.nu/, or "What the F am I gonna cook for dinner", a swedish site thatbrings the user proposals for dinner plans! 


Admin accounts are used to view a separate part of the application. In this view you can edit Style, Cookware, Ingredients and view users.
Most necessary changes to the database can be done from the admin-view.
